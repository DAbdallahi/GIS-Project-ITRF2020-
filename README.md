# GIS-Project ITRF2020 

This project focuses on processing and analyzing geographic data using the ITRF2020 (International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2020) model. It involves utilizing tools like QGIS and Python to handle, visualize, and interpret geospatial data effectively.

### Key Features
1. Data Preparation
   - Load and preprocess geospatial data for analysis.
   - Perform coordinate transformations based on the ITRF2020 reference model.
2. Visualization
   - Create detailed maps for analyzing geospatial trends.
   - Generate vector and raster layers for comprehensive visualization.
3. Data Analysis
   - Analyze elevation models, terrain features, and spatial relationships.
   - Perform overlay analysis for intersecting geospatial datasets.

### Tools and Technologies
- Software: QGIS, Python
- Libraries: GDAL, PyQGIS, Matplotlib
- Data Format: GeoTIFF, Shapefile, CSV
